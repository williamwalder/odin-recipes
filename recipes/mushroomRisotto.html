    <h1>Mushroom Risotto</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
    <img src="../images/mushroomRisotto.jpg" alt="Mushroom Risotto">
    <p>A creamy, savory Italian dish that is pure comfort food.  It starts with sauteed onions
        and garlic, followed by Arborio rice slowly cooked in a flavorful broth while stirring
        continuously.  Sliced mushrooms are added to the mix, infusing the risotto with their
        richness.  As the rice absorbs the broth, it becomes tender and creamy.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups chicken broth, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>
            <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat. Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
